# Macroeconomic Context
South Korea’s Economic Slowdown: GDP growth is projected at 1.8% in 2025, with reduced consumer spending due to high interest rates and inflation (2.3% YoY) .
Weakened KRW: The Korean won’s depreciation (-8% vs USD in 2024) increases import costs for luxury goods, pressuring margins.

# Korean Luxury Market Dynamics
Polarization Accelerating:

VIP clients (top 1%) drive 51% of luxury sales at Galleria Department Store .

Mid-tier brands like Celine face double-digit declines as consumers shift to ultra-luxury (Hermès/Chanel) or affordable K-fashion .

Gen Z Preferences:

TikTok dominates trendsetting, with hashtags like #CelineTriomphe (12M views) showing mixed sentiment (45% positive, 30% "overpriced") .
Demand for "quiet luxury" (minimalist designs) clashes with Celine’s logo-centric heritage.

Polarization: Luxury spending is concentrated among VIPs (contributing 45–51% of department store revenue) . Mid-tier brands like Celine face headwinds, while Hermès/Chanel/LV dominate.


# Competitor Analysis
Chanel: 2025 price hikes (+7% for Classic Flap Bag) reinforce exclusivity but alienate younger buyers .


# Strategic Recommendations
VIP-Centric Reboot: exclusive trunkshows (e.g., limited-edition Triomphe bags) to retain high-net-worth clients.
3. Pricing Strategy: Moderate price hikes (3–5%) to balance prestige and accessibility, avoiding Chanel-level increases around 7-10%.
4. E-commerce Optimization: Enhance virtual try-on tools and KakaoTalk Gift Shop integration.
5. Improved Client Experience through Omni-channel Connectivity: Online Appointment Booking services for Offline, chatbots
6. Flagship Boutique
